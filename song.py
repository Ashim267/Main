And it doesn't seem to be getting much better
There's kids playing games on the pavement
Drawing waves on the pavement, mhm
Shadows of the planes on the pavement, mhm
It's enough to make me cry
But that don't seem like it would make it feel better
Maybe it's a dream, and if I scream
It will burst at the seams
Whole place will fall into pieces
And then they'd say"""
verse2="""Puzzle pieces in the ground
No one ever seems to be digging
Instead, they're looking up towards the heavens
With their eyes on the heavens, mhm
The shadows on the way to the heavens, mhm
It's enough to make me cry
But that don't seem like it would make it feel better
The answers could be found
We could learn from digging down
But no one ever seems to be digging
Instead they'll say"""
verse3="""Words of wisdom all around
But no one ever seems to listen
They're talking about their plans on the paper
Building up from the pavement, mhm
The shadows from the scrapers on the pavement, mhm
It's enough to make me sigh
But that don't seem like it would make feel better
The words are all around
But the words are only sounds
And no one ever seems to listen
Instead they'll say"""

I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell, no, no, no
If you keep adding stones
Soon the water will be lost in the well, mhm"""
